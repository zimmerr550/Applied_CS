An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word. For example, cinema is an anagram of iceman.

The mechanics of the game are as follows:

The game provides the user with a word from the dictionary.
The user tries to create as many words as possible that contain all the letters of the given word plus one additional letter. Note that adding the extra letter at the beginning or the end without reordering the other letters is not valid. For example, if the game picks the word 'ore' as a starter, the user might guess 'rose' or 'zero' but not 'sore'.
The user can give up and see the words that they did not guess.
In order to ensure that the game is not too difficult, the computer will only propose words that have at least 5 possible valid anagrams.


This contains some optional extensions.
Two-letter mode: switch to allowing the user to add two letters to form anagrams
Optimize word selection by removing words that do not have enough anagrams from the pool of possible starter words. Note that those words should still remain in original file since they can still be used as anagrams to other words.
Two-word mode: Allow the user to add one letter to a pair of words to form two new valid words.
